# zanatyp-rofessional-readme-generator

This project is to creat a high-quality README for the app When creating an open source project on GitHub. The README includes what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributionsâ€”this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

You can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project.

To create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package (Links to an external site.). Review the Guide to a Professional README (Links to an external site.) as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain.

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

node index.js

AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under

Getting Started
Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ so that your node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies.

Make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. You can create one by running npm init when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.

Include a video of the typical user flow through your application. This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection.

Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers or other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.
